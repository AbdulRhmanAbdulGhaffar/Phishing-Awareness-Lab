## 🔒 Essential Technical Defenses

- Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA/2FA): The single most effective defense. If your password is stolen, the attacker still cannot log in without the second factor.

Keep Software Updated: Regularly update your operating system, browser, and antivirus software.

Report Phishing: Always report suspicious emails to the legitimate company being impersonated and to your email provider.
